        <p class="mb1">Papaya templates work in many situations, but you may need something a little more robust and tailored to your goals.</p>

        <p class="mb1">I've been working in design, development, and product management for years and built web projects for many clients. Landing pages are one of my specialities. I make beautiful, responsive, performant pages aimed at helping you achieve your specific objectives.</p>

        <p class="mb1">We'll start with an initial meeting, perform research, then move on to wireframes before jumping into actual prototypes. Usually, you'll have a new landing page ready to go in a few weeks.</p>
